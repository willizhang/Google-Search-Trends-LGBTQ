## Google Trends Analysis: LGBTQ+ and Summer Fruits

This repository contains the dataset and R scripts exploring trends in Google search interest for the topic “LGBTQ” and comparisons with summer fruits “mango” and “watermelon.”

#### Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the increasing interest in LGBTQ+ topics using Google Trends data. Key aspects include:
* **Trends over time:** Understanding how search interest has evolved in Sweden, the UK, and the US.
* **Seasonal patterns:** Peaks in search interest during events like Pride Month.
* **Comparisons:** Using relatable topics like summer fruits (mango and watermelon) to add context to the trends.

#### Data Source

The data is sourced from [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all,all,all,all,all&geo=GB,SE,US,GB,GB&q=%2Fm%2F0hn10,%2Fm%2F0hn10,%2Fm%2F0hn10,%2Fm%2F0fldg,%2Fm%2F0kpqd&hl=en-GB) and includes:
* LGBTQ (Topic)
* Summer Fruits: Mango and watermelon, selected for their seasonal search patterns.

The Google Trends data is normalized (scaled from 0 to 100), so it reflects relative search interest rather than absolute volumes.

#### Visualizations

The following visualizations are included:
* LGBTQ+ Trends Over Time: Global and country-specific trends (e.g., US, UK, Sweden).
* Comparisons with Summer Fruits: Exploring search interest for “LGBTQ+” alongside seasonal fruits like mango and watermelon.
